# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model on a dummy dataset. KNN is a simple and effective classification and regression algorithm that is based on finding the K-nearest data points in the training dataset to make predictions for new data points.

## Dataset
The dummy dataset used in this project is located in the repository. It includes the following files:

* Classified_data: The main dataset containing features and labels.

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

### Training the KNN Model
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Train the KNN model.
3. Do Hyperparameter Tuning.

### Evaluation
Evaluate the KNN model on the test dataset.

## Results
Provide insights and analysis of the model's performance. You can include visualizations, confusion matrices, or any relevant metrics.
